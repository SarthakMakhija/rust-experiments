### Repository to try a few things in Rust

1. Rust lifetime
   - Iterator examples; both readonly and mutable iterator `src/iterator`
      - Comments are present in the code to describe the lifetimes

2. Serialization and de-serialization a fixed size struct
   - Uses [rkyv](https://github.com/rkyv/rkyv)
